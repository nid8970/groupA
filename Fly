There was an old lady who swallowed a fly;

I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a spider; That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!

She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady that swallowed a dog; What a hog, to swallow a dog!

She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, She swallowed the bird to catch the spider; That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
